This repository showcases various Playwright testing techniques, demonstrating them through the end-to-end purchase flow of an e-commerce website, providing learners with practical examples for building robust and scalable automation.

ClientAppOtherWay: Demonstrates end-to-end purchase flow validation using Playwright's modern, resilient locators, teaching best practices for stable UI testing.

ClientAppPO: Illustrates a scalable framework with the Page Object Model (POM) and data-driven testing in TypeScript, crucial for modular and maintainable test suites.

NetworkTest.spec.js: Explores API-driven order placement and network interception to simulate UI states, teaching how to control front-end behavior via backend manipulation.

NetworkTest2.spec.js: Focuses on security testing through request interception, redirecting order details to an unauthorized ID to verify error handling.

upload-download.spec.js: Covers reading and writing Excel files, downloading content from a web table, modifying data, and asserting changes, essential for file-based interactions.

WebAPIPart1.spec.js: Shows setting up an API context to create orders and authenticate without UI, then verifying these API actions on the front end.

WebAPIPart2.spec.js: Teaches state management by saving authenticated sessions to avoid repeated logins, optimizing test execution for full purchase flow validation.
